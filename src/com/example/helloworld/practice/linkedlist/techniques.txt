1. Slow runner / fast runner approach
   a. Kth node from last
   b. to find middle element in the linked list
   c. to detect the loop in the list

2. Merge two linked lists- find interesection point. Find len1, len2 of two lists and advance one to ~(len1-len2) and find intersection

3. Reversing a linked list
    a. reverse every k nodes in a list (use recursion and come from the last)

4.

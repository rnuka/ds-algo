1. Solve smaller problem, its all about being lazy. You just do something and give the remaining sub-problems to your children

2. Top-down or bottom-up approach

3. Solve for no input, 1 input, 2 & 3. Then it will take care itself in solving the remaining n-3 problems.
    a. Powerset problem. solve [ {} ] , [ {}, {a} ], [ {}, {a}, {b}, {a,b} ] once you solve this, apply the same logic recursively
    
4. recursion should be very intuitive and very simple, if we are getting stuck which means the logic was complicated. Stop coding and go
   back to define the logic, recursive function paramters, identify the base case and return types.
